                                        Job Application

I will provide some detailed exaplanation about my job Application:
- firstly when you run the program it will ask you to select either the admin or the applicant, 

1. Lets say we are the applicants:
In the applicant method there are 5 functions an applicant can interact with the system :
1. Fill Form: If the applicant want to fill an application form they should select this number.
2. View Form: The applicant can view their application.
3. Submit Application: If the applicant submitted the application, then (behind the program it means that we are creating
an application instance. and the job is automatically getting submited)
4. Withdraw Form: This is to show the applicant track, if they no longer want to apply to the program they can just withdraw.
But if they want to submit, they have chance to make it active and then submit.
5. Back to Main Menu : this option is to go back to the admin Menu (in real life, I should have made it in different use
but becuase of time constraint i just worked it as selection option)

2. On the admin page:
The admin is one who is reposnsible of all the applications. The applicant is only responsible of their form.
So in the admin part we also have options:
1. Add Job Application: this is when the administartor want to add the application to the system after the user have submitted.If you do the adding 
first before submitting the application empty value of the form will be added. "After the user has submitted the application is added already,
and then if you add again, you will have two application.
2. Search Job Applications: Based on the critria found in the form, admin can search any application they want.
3. Update Job Application: so here the admin has the responsibiliy to go to the applicant form and update some details like name
and mobile phone of users.
4. Delete Job Application: Admin can delete the application if they no longer want any application in their system.
5. Display All Job Applications:  The admin can display application available in the system.
